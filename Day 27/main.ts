// Question 79: Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing a car with properties 
// for make, model, and year. Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.

// creating and accessing object properties:

let car ={
    make: "suzuki",
    model: "swift",
    year: 2022
};
// accessing the model property of the car:
console.log(`the car make ${car.make} and model is ${car.model} and year ${car.year} `)
console.log(car.model)

// Question 80: Updating Object Properties: Add a property named color to the existing car object, 
// and then update the year property to 2021. Show how to perform these operations.

// updating object properties:

let car1 ={
    make: "suzuki",
    model: "swift",
    year: 2022,
    color: "White",
};
// update year property and color
car1.color = "White";
car1.year = 2023;
console.log(car1)

// Question 81: Iterating Over Object Properties: Write a function that takes an object as an argument and logs all of its properties and values.

// iterating over object properties:

function objectProperties(obj: object) {
    for (let property in obj) {
        console.log(`${property}: ${obj[property]}`);
        
        };
    };
    objectProperties({make:"suzuki",model:"swift",year:2023,color:"white"})

    
function myBioData(name:object){
    for(let data in name){
        console.log(`${data}: ${name[data]}`);
    }
}
myBioData({name:"muhammad Tahir",age:35,gender:"male",education:"Graduation",hobby:"Cricket"})
