// Question 49: Function with Rest Parameters: Write a function that takes a rest parameter representing multiple hobbies. It should log each hobby 
// with a statement saying you enjoy that hobby.
// Explain & TIP: Rest parameters allow a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to handle multiple inputs 
// gracefully.
function logHobbies(...hobbies) {
    hobbies.forEach(hobby => {
        console.log(`I enjoy ${hobby}.`);
    });
}
logHobbies("Cricket", "Footbal", "Reading Book", "General knowledge");
// Question 50: Multiline Template Literals: Use template literals to create a multiline string that describes your ideal day. Include
// at least three different activities.
// Explain & TIP: Template literals support multiline strings, making it easier to create readable text blocks that 
//incorporate variables and expressions.
let activities = `I have completed the my first project that day is my ideal day.
1: I am palying cricket daily in the morning.
2: I am studing in Governor House.
3: I read daily news paper at the time of Break fast. `;
console.log(activities);
// Question 51: Refactoring to Arrow Functions: Take a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle and refactor it into an arrow function.
// Explain & TIP: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript and TypeScript, making your code cleaner and more readable.
function calculateArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}
const width = 10;
const height = 5;
const area = calculateArea(width, height);
console.log("The area of rectangle is width", width, "and height is", height, "area is", area);
// Refactored into an arrow function
let calculateAreaArrow = (width, height) => width * height;
console.log(calculateAreaArrow(5, 8));
export {};
